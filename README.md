#LASSO Medical Image Classification Toolbox (Shimizu, July 2016)

This toolbox was developed to facilitate reproduction of the procedure given in Shimizu et al., PLoS ONE 10(5)2015 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0123524)

The code makes use of following toolboxes: 
- spm8 [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/]
- NIFTI_20110921 [https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image]
- SLEP [http://www.yelab.net/software/SLEP/]

They are already included in the toolbox under LASSOMedIC/main/downloads.
Redundant functions as well as redundant code possible.

The manual is so far only a list of points I considered necessary to work with the program and will be updated.
